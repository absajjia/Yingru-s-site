             SEVENTEEN is a self-producing Korean boy group consisting of 13 members under the company Pledis Entertainment.
             <br>They debuted on May 26, 2015 with the song Adore U.
             <br> Within SEVENTEEN, there are 3 subunits, the Vocal Team, the Performance Team, and the Hiphop Team. More info on the teams later.
             <br> They are named SEVENTEEN because 13 members + 3 subunits + 1 overall team = 17.
             <br> This page is where I'll pour my love for them into my homework.

              An Ode to Seventeen:
            </h4>
          </header>
         <p>
         The name of Seventeen's fandom is Carats. If you are a big fan of Seventeen then you are referred to as a Carat. 
          <br>
           My favorite member is Jun because I find his awkward and cat-like personality and lighthearted energy absolutely adorable and endearing.
           <br>
           But all the members are absolutely full of talent and are some of the most supportive and funny idols I have ever seen. Their passion and hard-working nature is also something that cannot be understated. They pour everything they have into their performances on stage.
           <br>
           They take any opportunity to not only show their gratitude and love for Carats, but also to each other. They treat and support each other like family and it just makes my heart ache. 
           <br>
           They represent a part of my youth, a time when I am carefree and full of energy to love and obsess.
           <br>
           Seungcheol, Jeonghan, Joshua, Junhui, Soonyoung, Wonwoo, Jihoon, Minghao, Mingyu, Seokmin, Seungkwan, Vernon, Chan: I love you all so much and I feel with each passing day I love you more and more. Please be well and I wish you the same amount of happiness you have given me.
